## 🧩 Core Components

| **Contract** | **Purpose** | **Key Security Features** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `SharedSubscriptionToken` | Manages token purchases, group memberships, and credential encryption | Reentrancy guards, role-based access control, expiration checks |
| `SubscriptionServiceProvider` | Handles payment processing and encrypted credential storage | Input validation, payment receiver isolation, owner restrictions |
| `SubscriptionVoting` | Governs member removal through proposals and voting | Vote cooldowns, majority verification, execution timeouts |
| `ReentrancyAttack` | Demonstrates security through simulated attack vectors | Attack pattern logging, emergency withdrawal |

## ⚙️ Key Functionality

### 1. **Tokenized Access System**

**Flow:**

- Users buy tokens at 0.01 ETH/token through `buyTokens()`
- Spend 1 token to join/create subscription groups via `subscribe()`
- Groups auto-renew through pooled ETH payments

---

### 2. **Credential Management**

- RSA public key registration (`registerPublicKey()`)
- Owner-stored encrypted credentials using user's public key
- On-demand decryption through `getEncryptedCredentials()`

---

### 3. **Governance Mechanism**

**Voting Process:**

1. Members propose removals via `proposeToKickUser()`
2. Checking protocols is done
3. Rate limiting of proposals (12 hour default)
4. Allow users to vote
5. Automated execution through `executeProposal()`
```solidity
// Check if proposal passed
if (proposal.yesVotes >= requiredVotes) {
    // Verify user is still a member before kicking (they might have left already)
    if (subscriptionToken.isMemberOfAccount(proposal.userToKick, proposal.serviceId, proposal.accountId)) {
        // Call the main contract to remove the user
        subscriptionToken.kickUser(proposal.serviceId, proposal.accountId, proposal.userToKick);
        successful = true;
    }
}
emit ProposalExecuted(proposalId, proposal.serviceId, proposal.accountId, proposal.userToKick, successful);
}
```


---

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

### 1. **Reentrancy Protection**

Set a flag to prevent malicious contracts from reentering during external payments:

```solidity
modifier nonReentrant() {
    require(!_locked, "Reentrancy detected");
    _locked = true;
    _;
    _locked = false;
}

// Used in all payment functions
function withdrawFunds() external onlyOwner nonReentrant {...}
```


---

### 2. **Attack Simulation**

The `ReentrancyAttack` contract demonstrates:

- Recursive call attempts during token purchases
- ETH balance manipulation checks
- Attack pattern logging through events

**Prevention Evidence:**

```
Test Results:

    Security: Reentrancy
Attack count (reentrant calls): 0n
Stolen tokens: 1n
      ✔ Should prevent reentrancy on buyTokens
```

## 🏢 Subscription Service Provider

The `SubscriptionServiceProvider` contract acts as the service layer, simulating real-world subscription services. It manages available services, processes payments, and securely stores encrypted credentials for users.

**Key Features:**

- **Service Management:** The owner can add, update, and manage services with unique IDs, symbols (like "NFLX"), costs, and mock API endpoints.
- **Payment Processing:** Only the trusted token contract can process payments, ensuring users are marked as subscribed only after successful payment.
- **Credential Security:** Encrypted credentials are stored and managed per user and service, accessible only through the token contract.
- **Subscription Tracking:** Tracks which users are subscribed to which services.
- **Access Control:** Critical functions are restricted to the contract owner or the authorized token contract, protecting against unauthorized actions.
- **Funds Handling:** The owner can withdraw funds to a designated payment receiver address.

> This contract ensures that only legitimate, paid users can access subscription credentials, and it integrates seamlessly with the rest of the system for secure and efficient subscription management.

## ✅ Expected Test Coverage

```
  SharedSubscriptionToken
Initial token balance: 0n
Final token balance: 5n
    ✔ Should allow users to buy tokens

Original service cost: 10000000000000000000
Cost per member: 3333333333333333333
Cost per member * 3: 9999999999999999999
    ✔ Should calculate cost per member correctly
Initial subscription status: true
Final subscription status: false
    ✔ Should expire subscriptions after the designated time
    ✔ Should allow users to renew their subscriptions
